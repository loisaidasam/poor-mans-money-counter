Ever wonder where you're money's going?

I wrote this app in Slovenia to keep track.

It works like this:

-   First you go to your bank and set it up so that your bank account sends you SMS messages anytime money is withdrawn (yeah, you can do that in Europe)
-   The app intercepts incoming text messages from your bank
-   It then parses out the amount spent, converts it to a float, and subtracts that amount from a running total

That's it. Poor man's money counter. Any questions?!
